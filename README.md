# Zero Motorcycles Home Assistant Integration

This project is an attempt to create an integration to consume services provided by
Zero Motorcycles for their 3rd gen electric motorcycles that come with integrated
cellular connection and cloud service.

Some information about these services can be found in the documentation of this
project: https://bitbucket.org/cappelleh/zengo-android/src/master/

## About

Here is a picture of my 14.4 kWh Zero SRF premium with charge tank for 12 kW
maximum charging power (if conditions are met).

## Notice

I have since sold this motorcycle (went to France!) and now mostly ride a 2021
Energice SS9+ with 21.5 kWh battery and 24 kW charge speed.
